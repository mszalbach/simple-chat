### Introduction
This document explains the Architecture of the simple-chat project. simple-chat is a chat website written in Java and hosted
in Docker containers.

It should use all the practices and principles learned by me but never could use in a simple environment. So this is a playing ground
for Docker, BDD and also Arc42.
